Depends on bitcoinjs-lib.\r\n\r\nAssumptions\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBitcoin privacy leaks are [dangerous](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908) both for users, value and [fungibility](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=333882.0). All wallets should support mixing techniques so tainting analysis can be foiled and preserve users privacy.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we have the following base proposals:\r\n\r\n* [CoinJoin](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=279249.0)\r\n* [CoinSwap](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=321228.0) (specialised CoinJoin with 2 people)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
